This project interacts with Noroff's API Online Store, handling dynamic product listings, detailed views, a shopping cart, and a contact form with validation. This project demonstrates core front-end development skills, API handling, and UI/UX considerations for a real-world application.",
    reflection:
      "When I first created the project, the codebase was functional but lacked comprehensive documentation. the absence of JSDoc comments makes it harder for others to quickly grasp the intent, usage, and expected data of various parts of the application. Therefore I have added documentation as a calculated improvement to enhance the maintainability and readability of the code.",
